# 🚀 CyberShield AI - Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

✅ **Repository Status**: GitHub repository updated with latest changes
✅ **App File**: `streamlit_app.py` - Main application file
✅ **Configuration**: `.streamlit/config.toml` - 1GB upload configuration
✅ **Dependencies**: `requirements.txt` - All required packages listed
✅ **Local Testing**: App running successfully on localhost:8501

## 🌐 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Direct Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. **Visit Streamlit Cloud**
   - Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Deploy New App**
   - Click "New app"
   - Repository: `sayaksatpathi/cybershield-ai-streamlit`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file path: `streamlit_app.py`

3. **Advanced Settings** (Important for 1GB uploads)
   - Click "Advanced settings"
   - Confirm the app will use the `.streamlit/config.toml` settings
   - The 1GB upload limit is configured in the config file

### Option 2: Automatic GitHub Integration

Since your repository is already connected, Streamlit Cloud should automatically:
- Detect the `streamlit_app.py` file
- Use the `.streamlit/config.toml` configuration
- Install packages from `requirements.txt`
- Deploy with 1GB upload capability

## 📊 Deployment Configuration

### Repository Details
- **Repository**: https://github.com/sayaksatpathi/cybershield-ai-streamlit
